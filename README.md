## Introduction

AstraZeneca Code Club's Beginner's Python course is designed for anyone completely new to Python or even programming in general. The course is self-contained and approaches the language in a slow and friendly manner, assuming no prior knowledge. All of our resources are free to be used by anyone—AZ employee or not. If you are an employee of AZ however, make sure you follow the Code Club group on Workplace for updates, support, and general Python fun.

Have fun learning!

## Getting Started

### Using Google Colab (Recommended)

To make learing Python as simple as possible, we have centred our course around the use of Google Colab, a free, interactive cloud environment for Python programming. You can get setup with Colab by visiting [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/) or searching for Google Colab (using Google Chrome, as this has the best compatibility, unsurprisingly). Sign up using a Google account and get started by going to `File > New Python 3 Notebook`. 

All of our exercise and solution sheets also have links to open them in Colab. Once you are finished with your work, save these to your own drive using `File > Save a Copy in Drive`.

### Using Anaconda Locally (Optional)

If you wish to avoid using Google Colab or want to code without an internet connection, you can setup up Anaconda on your computer to obtain a similiar, but local, experience. If you are on an AZ computer, use the software store to download this, and for personal computers visit [this link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Once you have Anaconda installed, open the Anaconda Navigator (this is just a normal program you'll find in your start menu). Then, launch 'Jupyter Notebook' and click `New > Python 3 Notebook`. This will create a blank Python 3 notebook just like with Colab. You can still use our templates by downloading the raw file from GitHub, placing it in your documents, and navigating to it in Jupyter.

## Using This Repository

Each session is contained in its own folder and includes the Powerpoint presentation given in the session, an answer template for the session exercises, a homework sheet to practice your skills, as well as corresponding solutions. All exercise and solutions notebooks will contain a link at the top of the page to open the document in Google Colab

The project solution is intended to be a model solution containing full documentation and testing. It is not expected for you to add such additional components to your solution but rather you should focus on the essential parts. A full solution is only provided as indication of the direction we want to be heading in and to build up experience with looking at source code.

## Quick Access to Resources

We are still working on transferring the course to this repo, improving and standardising the content in the process. Links will appear here as soon as they are ready (which hopefully won't be long). If you want to be updated when changes are made, sign up to GitHub and click the watch icon at the top of the page (whilst you're at it, stars are appreciated!).

## Session Summaries

### Session 1

* Get set up on Google Colab
* Let Python 'talk' to you using the `print()` function
* Use Python as a basic calculator
* Give Python 'memory' using variables

### Session 2

* 'Talk' back to Python using the `input()` function
* Learn why variable types are important
* Use lists to store multiple numbers
* Compute attributes of lists such as total, length, minimum and maximum

### Session 3

* Learn how to compare two difference numbers with comparison operators
* Combine conditions using Boolean operators
* Add logic to your code using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
* Use `while` loops to repeatedly run blocks of code

### Session 4

* Recap the use of lists in Python and use them to store more than just numbers
* Learn how to access invidual items of lists as well as extract slices
* Manipulate lists, adding, removing, and altering elements
* Understand the difference and similarities between tuples and lists

### Session 5

* Learn how to use `for` loops to run code a predetermined number of times
* Loop through lists and ranges of numbers
* Escape loops using `break` and `continue`
